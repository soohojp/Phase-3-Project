## Business Understanding

Our client, Flu Heroes, is a vaccine advocacy Non-Governmental Organization that has a goal of improving access to the seasonal flu vaccine to all. The Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website detailing outcome of Public Health Laboratories flu tests carried between October, 2021 and February, 2022, reveals a positive rate of c.2% for Influenza A and Influenza B. 

### Goal: 

The goal of this project is to determine what backgrounds, opinions, or health behaviors predict personal vaccination patterns of individuals. Taking it a step further, Flu Heroes will use insights gleaned from this project in allocating resources to the areas that can increase the annual seasonal flu vaccine numbers.
